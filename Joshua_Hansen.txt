Aloha,

My name is Joshua Hansen from Utah, and I am majoring in computer science. 
This is my final semester and my final Computer Science course which I am excited to take. 

My project idea is to create an web app like chegg, where users can post questions from homework assingments and other users can post answers to those questions.
