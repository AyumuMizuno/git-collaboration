Aloha,

My name is Seyeon Kim. I am from South Korea. My major is computer science. I am really happy to 
take this class. 
My project idea is to make an application like internet clothing shopping mall 
that has the advantage of people can quickly identifying which shopping mall's products are currently the most popular.
